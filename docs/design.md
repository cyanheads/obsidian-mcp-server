# Obsidian MCP Server — Design

## MCP Surface

### Tools

| # | Name | Description | Key Inputs | Annotations |
|:--|:-----|:------------|:-----------|:------------|
| 1 | `obsidian_get_note` | Read a note's content, structured metadata (frontmatter/tags/stat — parsed by the upstream plugin), or section structure (document map). Works against any vault path, the active file, or a periodic note. | `target`, `format` (`content`/`full`/`document-map`), `section?` | `readOnlyHint`, `idempotentHint` |
| 2 | `obsidian_write_note` | Create or overwrite a note (whole file) or replace a single section in place. Idempotent. | `target`, `content`, `section?`, `contentType?` | `idempotentHint`, `destructiveHint` |
| 3 | `obsidian_append_to_note` | Append content to the end of a note, or to the end of a heading/block/frontmatter section. | `target`, `content`, `section?`, `contentType?`, `createTargetIfMissing?` | (none — additive) |
| 4 | `obsidian_patch_note` | Surgical edit of a heading, block reference, or frontmatter field. Supports `append`/`prepend`/`replace`. The right tool when you need precise placement inside an existing document. | `target`, `section`, `operation`, `content`, `contentType?`, `patchOptions?` | `destructiveHint` (always — worst-case across operations) |
| 5 | `obsidian_delete_note` | Permanently delete a note. Elicits human confirmation when the client supports it. | `target` | `destructiveHint` |
| 6 | `obsidian_replace_in_note` | String or regex search-replace inside a single note. Composed read → mutate → write at the service layer (no native upstream endpoint). Per-replacement `useRegex`/`caseSensitive`/`replaceAll` flags. | `target`, `replacements: [{ search, replace, useRegex?, caseSensitive?, replaceAll? }]` | `destructiveHint` |
| 7 | `obsidian_manage_frontmatter` | Atomic `get` / `set` / `delete` on a single frontmatter key. `set` uses PATCH; `delete` uses read-modify-write because PATCH has no delete operation. Avoids rewriting the whole file for `get` and `set`. | `target`, `operation`, `key`, `value?` (set only) | `destructiveHint` (set/delete) |
| 8 | `obsidian_manage_tags` | Add, remove, or list a note's tags across both frontmatter (`tags:` array) and inline (`#tag`) syntax. Service layer reconciles both locations. | `target`, `operation`, `tags?: string[]`, `location?: 'frontmatter'\|'inline'\|'both'` (default `both`) | `destructiveHint` (add/remove) |
| 9 | `obsidian_list_files` | List files and subdirectories at a vault path. Defaults to vault root. Optional client-side filters by extension and name. | `path?`, `extension?`, `nameRegex?` | `readOnlyHint`, `idempotentHint` |
| 10 | `obsidian_search_notes` | Search the vault. Modes: `text` (substring + context, with optional `pathPrefix` filter), `dataview` (DQL `TABLE` query — use this for path/date/metadata filters), `jsonlogic` (structured filter on `NoteJson`). | `mode`, `query`, `contextLength?`, `pathPrefix?` (text mode) | `readOnlyHint` |
| 11 | `obsidian_list_tags` | All tags found across the vault, with usage counts. Includes hierarchical parents (e.g. `work` for `work/tasks`). | (none) | `readOnlyHint`, `idempotentHint` |
| 12 | `obsidian_list_commands` | List Obsidian command-palette commands available for execution. | (none) | `readOnlyHint`, `idempotentHint` |
| 13 | `obsidian_execute_command` | Execute an Obsidian command by ID (from `obsidian_list_commands`). Behavior is opaque — some commands are destructive (e.g. delete file), some open UI. **Registered only when `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS=true`.** | `commandId` | `openWorldHint`, `destructiveHint` |
| 14 | `obsidian_open_in_ui` | Open a file in the Obsidian app UI. **Creates the note if it doesn't exist** (upstream side effect — verify the path first if you only intend to open). Useful for surfacing a note to the human after agent edits. | `path`, `newLeaf?` | `openWorldHint`, `destructiveHint` |

### Common Input Shapes

Three reusable Zod shapes are referenced across multiple tools.

```ts
// `target` — where the note lives. Used by get/write/append/patch/delete.
const Target = z.discriminatedUnion('type', [
  z.object({ type: z.literal('path'),
    path: z.string().min(1).describe('Vault-relative path, e.g. "Projects/foo.md".') }),
  z.object({ type: z.literal('active') }),
  z.object({ type: z.literal('periodic'),
    period: z.enum(['daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'yearly']),
    date: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/).optional()
      .describe('ISO date YYYY-MM-DD. Omit for the current period.') }),
]);

// `section` — sub-document target inside a note. Optional on get/write/append; required on patch.
const Section = z.object({
  type: z.enum(['heading', 'block', 'frontmatter']),
  target: z.string().min(1)
    .describe('Heading name (use "::" for nesting), block reference (e.g. "2d9b4a"), or frontmatter field name.'),
});

// `patchOptions` — flags for obsidian_patch_note. All default false.
const PatchOptions = z.object({
  createTargetIfMissing: z.boolean().default(false),
  applyIfContentPreexists: z.boolean().default(false)
    .describe('Apply the patch even if matching content already exists in the target. Guards against double-applying.'),
  trimTargetWhitespace: z.boolean().default(false),
}).optional();

// `contentType` on write/append/patch — defaults to 'markdown'.
// 'json' is for typed frontmatter values and table-row inserts on block targets.
const ContentType = z.enum(['markdown', 'json']).default('markdown');
```

### Output Shapes

Sketches of the `structuredContent` payload each tool returns. `format()` renders the same data as markdown.

| Tool | Output |
|:-----|:-------|
| `obsidian_get_note` (`format: 'content'`) | `{ path, content }` |
| `obsidian_get_note` (`format: 'full'`) | `{ path, content, frontmatter, tags, stat: { ctime, mtime, size } }` |
| `obsidian_get_note` (`format: 'document-map'`) | `{ path, headings, blocks, frontmatterFields }` |
| `obsidian_get_note` (with `section`) | `{ path, section: { type, target }, value }` — `value` is the section's raw markdown, or the JSON value when `section.type === 'frontmatter'`. `format` is ignored when `section` is set. |
| `obsidian_write_note`, `obsidian_append_to_note` | `{ path, sectionTargeted: boolean, updatedContent?: string }` — the API returns the full updated file when section was targeted; we forward it. |
| `obsidian_patch_note` | `{ path, section, operation }` — upstream returns 200 with no body. |
| `obsidian_delete_note` | `{ path, deleted: true }` |
| `obsidian_replace_in_note` | `{ path, totalReplacements, perReplacement: [{ search, count }] }` |
| `obsidian_manage_frontmatter` (`get`) | `{ path, key, value, exists: boolean }` |
| `obsidian_manage_frontmatter` (`set`/`delete`) | `{ path, key, operation, frontmatter }` — full post-state frontmatter included for chaining |
| `obsidian_manage_tags` (`list`) | `{ path, tags: { frontmatter: string[], inline: string[], all: string[] } }` |
| `obsidian_manage_tags` (`add`/`remove`) | `{ path, operation, applied: string[], skipped: string[], tags: string[] }` — `applied` = tags actually changed; `skipped` = tags already in/not in the target location |
| `obsidian_list_files` | `{ path, files: string[], directories: string[] }` — split from the upstream's mixed `files[]` (entries ending in `/` are directories). Filters applied client-side after fetch. |
| `obsidian_search_notes` | `{ mode, results: SearchHit[], excluded?: { count, hint } }` — `SearchHit` is mode-discriminated (see Design Decisions § Search output shape). |
| `obsidian_list_tags` | `{ tags: [{ name, count }] }` |
| `obsidian_list_commands` | `{ commands: [{ id, name }] }` |
| `obsidian_execute_command` | `{ commandId, executed: true }` |
| `obsidian_open_in_ui` | `{ path, opened: true, createdIfMissing: boolean }` — `createdIfMissing` is best-effort (we check existence before the open call). |

### Resources

| URI Template | Description | Pagination |
|:-------------|:------------|:-----------|
| `obsidian://vault/{path}` | Note content as a stable, addressable URI. Mirrors `obsidian_get_note` with `format: 'full'`. | N/A (single note) |
| `obsidian://tags` | Vault tag listing with counts. Mirrors `obsidian_list_tags`. | None (single payload) |
| `obsidian://status` | Server reachability, plugin version, auth status. Reads `GET /` directly. | N/A |

### Prompts

None. The server exposes a CRUD/search surface — there is no recurring multi-turn pattern that benefits from a structured template.

## Overview

`obsidian-mcp-server` is an MCP server that exposes an Obsidian vault to LLM agents through the [Obsidian Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) plugin. It targets agent workflows over personal knowledge bases: reading and editing notes, browsing structure, searching content, working with daily/periodic notes, and triggering vault commands.

The server is a thin, opinionated wrapper around the plugin's HTTP API — one upstream service, well-defined endpoints, mostly 1:1 method semantics. Design effort goes into **collapsing the API's parallel "where does the note live" axes** (vault path, currently-active file, current periodic note, dated periodic note) into a single `target` discriminator so the agent doesn't navigate four separate tool families to do the same thing in different scopes.

**Target user:** an agent acting on behalf of a human who runs Obsidian locally with the Local REST API plugin enabled. Not multi-tenant; not a hosted service. Sessions are stdio or local HTTP.

---

## Requirements

- Wrap the Obsidian Local REST API (v3 PATCH semantics)
- Authenticate via API key (Bearer token) sourced from env var
- Support HTTPS to `127.0.0.1:27124` with self-signed cert (default) or HTTP to `:27123`
- Tolerate connection failures gracefully (Obsidian app may not be running)
- Surface clear recovery instructions when reachability or auth fails
- Expose every meaningful CRUD/search operation as a tool — no agent-visible capability locked behind resources
- Consolidate the four note-target axes (path/active/periodic-current/periodic-dated) into one `target` parameter on file tools
- Confirm destructive operations (delete) with `ctx.elicit` when available; fall back to `destructiveHint` annotation otherwise
- Single-tenant, local-first — no JWT/OAuth, no shared storage requirements

---

## Services

| Service | Wraps | Used By |
|:--------|:------|:--------|
| `ObsidianService` | Obsidian Local REST API HTTP endpoints. Holds API key + base URL config, builds requests with the appropriate `Accept`/`Content-Type`/`Target-*` headers, translates the `target` discriminator into URL paths, parses JSON/markdown responses, classifies errors. When `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL=false`, constructs a custom `undici.Agent` with `connect: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` and passes it as `dispatcher` on every fetch (Bun + Node 20+ both honor this — `fetch` itself has no `rejectUnauthorized` option). | Every tool and resource. |

**Resilience:** wrap each REST call with `withRetry` from `@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/utils`. Backoff: 200ms base, 3 attempts. Distinguish:

- **Connection refused** → `ServiceUnavailable` with message "Obsidian Local REST API is not reachable at {url}. Make sure Obsidian is running and the Local REST API plugin is enabled." Do not retry — Obsidian isn't going to restart between attempts.
- **401/403** → `Unauthorized`/`Forbidden` with "Verify `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY` matches the value shown in Obsidian → Settings → Local REST API." Do not retry.
- **404** → `NotFound` with the path/section that was missing.
  - When `target.type === 'active'`, surface "No file is currently active in Obsidian — open a file in the app first" instead of a generic not-found message.
  - When `target.type === 'path'`, the service does a single best-effort case-insensitive lookup against the parent directory's listing. If a match exists, append a hint to the error: `'File not found at "Projects/Foo.md". Did you mean "projects/foo.md"?'`. We do not silently retry — auto-correcting case hides bugs on case-sensitive filesystems. The hint gives the agent the recovery signal explicitly.
- **405** (path is a directory) → `InvalidParams` — the agent passed a directory path to a file operation.
- **5xx, network timeouts** → transient, retry with backoff.
- **400** → `InvalidParams` with the upstream error message preserved.

## Config

| Env Var | Required | Default | Description |
|:--------|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY` | yes | — | API key from Obsidian → Settings → Community Plugins → Local REST API. Bearer token sent on every request. |
| `OBSIDIAN_BASE_URL` | no | `https://127.0.0.1:27124` | Base URL of the Obsidian Local REST API. Use `http://127.0.0.1:27123` for the insecure HTTP port. |
| `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL` | no | `false` | Whether to verify the TLS certificate. Default `false` because the plugin uses a self-signed cert. Set `true` if you've imported the cert into a trust store. |
| `OBSIDIAN_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | `30000` | Per-request timeout. Searches against very large vaults can be slow; bump if you see timeouts. |
| `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS` | no | `false` | Opt-in flag for `obsidian_execute_command`. The tool isn't registered unless this is `true`. Off by default because Obsidian commands are opaque and can be destructive (delete file, close vault, etc.) — running one with the wrong ID can cause data loss the agent has no way to anticipate. |

Loaded via `parseEnvConfig` in `src/config/server-config.ts`.

## Implementation Order

1. **Config** — `src/config/server-config.ts` with the three env vars above
2. **Service** — `src/services/obsidian/obsidian-service.ts` with init/accessor pattern, the target → URL translator, the headers builder for PATCH/section targeting, and `withRetry` resilience
3. **Read-only tools** — `obsidian_get_note`, `obsidian_list_files`, `obsidian_list_tags`, `obsidian_list_commands`, `obsidian_search_notes`
4. **Resources** — `obsidian://vault/{path}`, `obsidian://tags`, `obsidian://status` (thin shims over the read tools' service methods)
5. **Write tools (single-call)** — `obsidian_write_note`, `obsidian_append_to_note`, `obsidian_patch_note`
6. **Composed tools (read-modify-write)** — `obsidian_replace_in_note`, `obsidian_manage_frontmatter`, `obsidian_manage_tags` (these stack on the single-call write tools)
7. **Side-effecting/destructive tools** — `obsidian_open_in_ui`, `obsidian_execute_command`, `obsidian_delete_note` (last because of elicit complexity)
8. **Tests** — `createMockContext` for handlers, `nock` or fetch mock for the service layer

Each step is independently runnable. After step 3 the server is already useful for read-only inspection.

## Domain Mapping

The Obsidian Local REST API exposes operations across four "targets" (where a note lives) and one common verb set. The design collapses the parallel axes.

### Target axes

| Target | URL pattern | Tool reaches it via |
|:-------|:------------|:--------------------|
| Vault path | `/vault/{path}` | `target: { type: 'path', path }` |
| Active file (currently open) | `/active/` | `target: { type: 'active' }` |
| Periodic note (current) | `/periodic/{period}/` | `target: { type: 'periodic', period }` |
| Periodic note (dated) | `/periodic/{period}/{year}/{month}/{day}/` | `target: { type: 'periodic', period, date }` |

### Verbs × targets (every cell maps to one consolidated tool)

| Verb | Vault path | Active | Periodic (cur) | Periodic (date) | Consolidated tool |
|:-----|:-----------|:-------|:---------------|:----------------|:------------------|
| GET | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | `obsidian_get_note` |
| PUT (replace) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | `obsidian_write_note` |
| POST (append) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | `obsidian_append_to_note` |
| PATCH (insert) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | `obsidian_patch_note` |
| DELETE | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | `obsidian_delete_note` |

That collapse is the central design move: 5 verbs × 4 targets = 20 endpoints, but only 5 tools.

### Other endpoints

| Endpoint | Tool |
|:---------|:-----|
| `GET /` | `obsidian://status` resource only — no tool (connection failures already surface clear errors via the resilience layer) |
| `GET /vault/`, `GET /vault/{dir}/` | `obsidian_list_files` |
| `POST /search/`, `POST /search/simple/` | `obsidian_search_notes` (mode-discriminated) |
| `GET /tags/` | `obsidian_list_tags` |
| `GET /commands/` | `obsidian_list_commands` |
| `POST /commands/{id}/` | `obsidian_execute_command` |
| `POST /open/{filename}` | `obsidian_open_in_ui` |
| `GET /openapi.yaml`, `GET /obsidian-local-rest-api.crt` | (skipped — utility endpoints with no agent value) |

### Composed tools (no single upstream endpoint)

These tools compose existing endpoints in the service layer rather than mapping 1:1.

| Tool | Composition |
|:-----|:------------|
| `obsidian_replace_in_note` | `GET /vault/{path}` (NoteJson) → apply replacements in memory → `PUT /vault/{path}` |
| `obsidian_manage_frontmatter` `get` | `GET /vault/{path}/frontmatter/{key}` (or NoteJson + lookup) |
| `obsidian_manage_frontmatter` `set` | `PATCH /vault/{path}` with `Operation: replace`, `Target-Type: frontmatter`, `Target: {key}`, JSON body |
| `obsidian_manage_frontmatter` `delete` | `GET /vault/{path}` (NoteJson) → strip key → `PUT /vault/{path}` (PATCH has no `delete` operation) |
| `obsidian_manage_tags` `list` | `GET /vault/{path}` (NoteJson) → return parsed `tags`, separated by location (frontmatter vs inline) |
| `obsidian_manage_tags` `add`/`remove` | `GET /vault/{path}` (NoteJson) → reconcile tags in frontmatter `tags:` array and inline `#tag` syntax per `location` → `PUT /vault/{path}` |

---

## Workflow Analysis

The most complex tool is `obsidian_patch_note` because it composes section targeting + operation mode + content type + four boolean flags. The handler call sequence is single-shot — no parallel fan-out, no elicit — but the parameter design is what matters:

`obsidian_patch_note` (single upstream call):

| # | Step | Notes |
|:--|:-----|:------|
| 1 | Resolve `target` to URL path | `path` → `/vault/{encodedPath}`, `active` → `/active/`, `periodic` → `/periodic/{period}/[{year}/{month}/{day}/]` |
| 2 | Build PATCH headers | `Operation`, `Target-Type`, `Target` (URL-encoded), `Target-Delimiter`, optional `Create-Target-If-Missing`, `Apply-If-Content-Preexists`, `Trim-Target-Whitespace` |
| 3 | Set `Content-Type` | `text/markdown` (default) or `application/json` (for tables and frontmatter values) |
| 4 | PATCH upstream | Single HTTP call |
| 5 | Classify response | 200 → success, 400 → `InvalidParams`, 404 → `NotFound`, 405 → `InvalidParams` (path is a directory) |

The other workflow that benefits from explicit thought is the **read → patch chain** an agent will commonly run:

```
obsidian_get_note(target, format: 'document-map')
  → tells agent which headings/blocks/frontmatter exist
obsidian_patch_note(target, section, operation, content)
  → modifies the right one
```

This is *not* a workflow tool (we don't merge it into one super-tool) — it's a deliberate two-step pattern. Document-map output is small and the agent often wants to choose the section based on its content. Forcing them to declare both upfront would be worse.

---

## Design Decisions

### Target discriminator instead of separate tool families

Every file operation in the OpenAPI exists in four flavors (vault path, active, periodic current, periodic dated). A naive 1:1 mapping would expose 20 tools (5 verbs × 4 targets). This is wasteful — the underlying semantics are identical, only the URL changes. A discriminated `target` parameter:

```ts
target: z.discriminatedUnion('type', [
  z.object({ type: z.literal('path'), path: z.string() }),
  z.object({ type: z.literal('active') }),
  z.object({ type: z.literal('periodic'),
    period: z.enum(['daily','weekly','monthly','quarterly','yearly']),
    date: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/).optional() }),
])
```

This collapses to 5 tools, with the correct URL chosen by a single switch in the service layer. The cost is one extra parameter on each tool; the benefit is a 4× smaller surface and one consistent mental model.

### Three write tools instead of one super-tool

`obsidian_write_note` (PUT), `obsidian_append_to_note` (POST), `obsidian_patch_note` (PATCH) overlap somewhat — PATCH-with-replace is similar to PUT-with-section, POST-with-section is similar to PATCH-with-append. Collapsing into one `obsidian_modify_note(operation: 'write'|'append'|'patch', ...)` was considered.

Kept separate because:
- Each has distinct annotations (`destructiveHint` differs)
- PATCH has 4 boolean flags none of the others use
- Required-vs-optional `section` differs (always required on PATCH, optional on the others)
- LLM tool selection is easier picking among three named tools than one tool with three modes

### Search modes consolidated under one tool

`POST /search/` and `POST /search/simple/` are different endpoints with different request bodies. Folded into one `obsidian_search_notes` tool with `mode: 'text'|'dataview'|'jsonlogic'`. The 80% case is `mode: 'text'`; the structured modes are escape hatches for power users.

### Search output shape (mode-discriminated)

The three search modes return different per-hit shapes upstream — `simple` returns match positions and context; `dataview` and `jsonlogic` return arbitrary `result` values that depend on the query. We surface that natively rather than forcing a normalized shape:

```ts
results: z.discriminatedUnion('mode', [
  z.object({ mode: z.literal('text'),
    hits: z.array(z.object({
      filename: z.string(),
      score: z.number().optional(),
      matches: z.array(z.object({
        context: z.string(),
        match: z.object({ start: z.number(), end: z.number() }),
      })),
    })) }),
  z.object({ mode: z.literal('dataview'),
    hits: z.array(z.object({ filename: z.string(), result: z.unknown() })) }),
  z.object({ mode: z.literal('jsonlogic'),
    hits: z.array(z.object({ filename: z.string(), result: z.unknown() })) }),
])
```

The alternative (one normalized hit shape with optional fields everywhere) loses the structural guarantee that `text` results always have `matches` while `dataview`/`jsonlogic` results always have `result`. Better to let the LLM see the right shape per mode.

### Search result truncation

`obsidian_search_notes` caps `hits` at **100 results**. When the upstream returns more, we keep the first 100 and add `excluded: { count: N, hint: 'Narrow your query (add filters, more specific terms) to surface the rest.' }` to the output. 100 is a pragmatic ceiling — large enough to cover normal exploratory queries against a personal vault, small enough that one tool call doesn't blow the context window. If this proves wrong in practice, easy to bump.

### `format()` is content-complete for every tool

Every tool's `format()` renders the same data as `structuredContent` — full content for `obsidian_get_note`, the per-mode hit list for `obsidian_search_notes`, the file/directory split for `obsidian_list_files`, etc. We do not return a thin "12 KB note loaded" stub from `format()` and rely on `structuredContent` for the actual data. Different MCP clients forward different surfaces (Claude Code → `structuredContent`, Claude Desktop → `content[]`); both must carry the same picture.

### Default `format: 'full'` on `obsidian_get_note`

The Obsidian API defaults to `text/markdown` (just content). We default to `'full'` (NoteJson — content + frontmatter + tags + stat). The size delta is small; structured metadata is meaningfully more useful to an LLM than raw YAML embedded in the markdown body. `'content'` and `'document-map'` remain available for size-sensitive or section-discovery cases.

We do **not** parse frontmatter ourselves. Setting `Accept: application/vnd.olrapi.note+json` tells the Obsidian Local REST API plugin to do the parsing and return the result as a `frontmatter` object inside NoteJson. That's the right boundary: no YAML parser dependency, no risk of diverging from how Obsidian itself interprets edge cases (date coercion, multi-line strings, tag syntax), and the plugin already merges inline `#tag` syntax with the frontmatter `tags:` field into the unified `tags` array.

### Composed convenience tools where the upstream API forces multi-step dances

Three operations that agents need constantly in knowledge-base workflows have no single upstream endpoint: search-replace inside a note, deleting a frontmatter key, and adding/removing a tag (which lives in two places — frontmatter `tags:` and inline `#tag`). Without dedicated tools, agents have to compose them by hand: read the note, mutate the body or YAML, write it back, and (for tags) reconcile both representations correctly.

We expose `obsidian_replace_in_note`, `obsidian_manage_frontmatter`, and `obsidian_manage_tags` as composed tools that do that work in the service layer. These are the highest-leverage adds in the design — they're more cognitive savings per byte of tool surface than anything else, and they prevent a class of agent bugs (forgetting that tags live in two places, clobbering frontmatter on a key delete, regex escaping in PATCH content). The API-faithful primitives (`get`/`write`/`patch`) remain available for cases the composed tools don't cover.

### Search filters: `pathPrefix` only on text mode

Adding `pathPrefix` to the `text` search mode is a cheap client-side string filter on returned filenames — worth adding because text-mode search is the common case and scoping to a folder is a frequent need. We deliberately do **not** add `modifiedSince`: the upstream `/search/simple` returns no stat data, so filtering by mod-time would require an extra `GET /vault/{path}` per hit to read `stat.mtime` — N round-trips for a search call. Agents that need date filters should use `dataview` mode where `file.mtime` is queryable in one call.

### Resources are intentionally minimal

Only three resources, all redundant with tools. They exist solely as a convenience for clients (Claude Desktop) that let users attach resources to a conversation. Tool-only clients (Claude Code, Cursor) lose nothing by ignoring them. We do not expose tags-by-name or commands-by-id as resources because there's no useful "stable URI for a tag" use case.

### `obsidian_delete_note` uses elicit

Note deletion is destructive and irreversible from the agent's side (no undo via the API; the human would need Obsidian's local trash). The handler calls `ctx.elicit` when present to confirm. When elicit isn't available (headless stdio), `destructiveHint: true` ensures the host's approval flow surfaces the risk. We did *not* exclude delete from the tool surface entirely — Obsidian's UI surfaces a recoverable trash, and the operation is a normal part of vault hygiene.

### `obsidian_execute_command` is gated and annotated `openWorldHint`

Command IDs are opaque strings whose behavior depends on which plugins the user has installed. We can't enumerate side effects. Two layers of safety:

1. **Registration gate via `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS`** (default `false`). The tool isn't even visible in `tools/list` unless the operator opts in. This ensures the default install can't trigger destructive Obsidian commands by accident — a sloppy agent invoking `obsidian_execute_command` with the wrong ID can't blow up a vault that never registered the tool. `obsidian_list_commands` stays available regardless so an agent can discover what would be possible if enabled.
2. **Annotations on the registered tool** — `openWorldHint: true` and `destructiveHint: true` route execution through host approval flows when the tool *is* enabled. The description warns explicitly.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Plugin must be running.** All operations fail if Obsidian isn't open with the Local REST API plugin enabled. The resilience layer surfaces this with a clear "Obsidian Local REST API is not reachable at {url} — make sure Obsidian is running and the Local REST API plugin is enabled" message; the `obsidian://status` resource provides the same check for clients that prefer to read it directly.
- **Self-signed certificate.** Default `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL=false` because the plugin generates a self-signed cert on first run. Users who want strict TLS need to import the cert into their trust store and set `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL=true`.
- **No batch operations.** The upstream API is single-target per request. Agents needing to fetch N notes will issue N parallel calls. Not a server limitation we can solve.
- **No move/rename.** The upstream API exposes no rename or move endpoint — only delete + create-at-new-path. Renaming a note in place loses block-reference and backlink integrity that Obsidian normally maintains during a UI-driven rename. We do **not** synthesize a move tool from delete+create for that reason. Agents that need this should ask the human to rename in Obsidian, or — when `OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_COMMANDS=true` — call `obsidian_execute_command` with the appropriate command ID and let Obsidian handle the rename properly.
- **No search pagination.** `POST /search/` returns all matches. We cap `hits` at 100 and surface `excluded.count` + a hint when there's more (see Design Decisions § Search result truncation).
- **PATCH v3 semantics only.** The plugin still supports the deprecated v2 PATCH protocol; we use v3 exclusively. If the user is on an old plugin version, PATCH calls will fail.
- **Single-tenant.** Auth is plugin API key, not per-user. The server is local-first and not designed for multi-tenant deployment. `tenantId` defaults to `'default'`.
- **No frontmatter typed access.** `obsidian_get_note` returns the upstream-parsed frontmatter as `Record<string, unknown>` because Obsidian frontmatter is freeform. Agents must validate values themselves.

## API Reference

### Auth

Bearer token via `Authorization: Bearer {OBSIDIAN_API_KEY}`. Every endpoint except `GET /` requires it.

### Servers

- `https://127.0.0.1:27124` — default, self-signed cert
- `http://127.0.0.1:27123` — insecure HTTP fallback

### Section targeting (PATCH/PUT/POST)

Headers:
- `Target-Type: heading | block | frontmatter`
- `Target: <name>` (URL-encoded if non-ASCII)
- `Target-Delimiter: ::` (for nested headings)

Headings nest with the delimiter: `Heading 1::Subheading 1:1::Subsubheading 1:1:1`.

### PATCH operation flags

- `Operation: append | prepend | replace` (required)
- `Create-Target-If-Missing: true | false` (default `false`)
- `Apply-If-Content-Preexists: true | false` (default `false`) — guards against double-applying the same patch
- `Trim-Target-Whitespace: true | false` (default `false`)

### Content types

- `text/markdown` — default, body is raw markdown
- `application/json` — body is JSON. Useful for:
  - Frontmatter values (preserves typing)
  - Table rows when patching a block-referenced table: `[["Chicago, IL", "16"]]`

### Document map

`Accept: application/vnd.olrapi.document-map+json` on any GET returns `{ headings, blocks, frontmatterFields }` — the catalog of valid PATCH targets in the document. Use before patching unfamiliar notes.

### Note JSON

`Accept: application/vnd.olrapi.note+json` instructs the plugin to parse YAML frontmatter and tags server-side, returning:

```json
{
  "content": "...",
  "frontmatter": { ... },
  "tags": ["..."],
  "path": "...",
  "stat": { "ctime": 0, "mtime": 0, "size": 0 }
}
```

### Search formats

- **Text** (`POST /search/simple?query=...&contextLength=100`) — substring match with surrounding context
- **Dataview DQL** (`Content-Type: application/vnd.olrapi.dataview.dql+txt`) — `TABLE` queries from the [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin (requires Dataview installed)
- **JsonLogic** (`Content-Type: application/vnd.olrapi.jsonlogic+json`) — structured filters over `NoteJson`. Custom operators: `glob` and `regexp`
